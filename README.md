# Lichess Unicorn Knights (Firefox)

A tiny Firefox extension that replaces the knight piece graphics on **lichess.org** with unicorn SVGs.

## Install (temporary / dev)

1. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on…**
3. Select: `extension/manifest.json`
4. Visit https://lichess.org and start a game / analysis board.

## How it works

- Injects a small CSS file on lichess.org.
- Overrides the background image of Chessground knight pieces.
